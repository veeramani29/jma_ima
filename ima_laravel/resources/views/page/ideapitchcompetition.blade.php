    <h5>About India Macro Advisors (IMA)</h5>
    <div class="sttl-line"></div>
  </div>
  <p>India Macro Advisors (IMA) is a macro-economic data portal offering concise and unbiased analysis on the Indian economy.  India Macro Advisors (IMA) is a start-up which is a privately-owned affiliate of the "Japan Macro Advisors Inc" (JMA). We (IMA) aim to keep improving on our service of providing concise analysis and easy access to well-structured macro-economic data since the data on the Indian economy is spread over many government websites in an unstructured format. Further, the Indian economy has always faced a problem of inadequacy of structured and "easy to use" accessible data. We feel that an economy should have an open data policy where the data should be public and easily available. We believe that the access to data should not be available just to corporates, researchers or policy makers, but for everyone in order to facilitate research across various sectors of the Indian economy.</p>

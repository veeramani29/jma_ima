	</div>
	<p>The official Indian macroeconomic data is spread over many government websites in an unstructured format. Indian economy has always faced a problem of inadequacy of structured and "easy to use" accessible data. We (IMA) feel that an economy should have an open data policy where the data should be easily available. We believe that the access to data should not just be available to corporates, researchers or policy makers, but for everyone.</p>
	<p>We aim to provide well-structured interactive online database portal for the Indian economy along with a concise and insightful analysis on the data. This would facilitate research across various sectors of the Indian economy. We hope such open and easy access to data would lead to a better understanding of the Indian economy among the general public, businesses, researchers and help them make better and informed decisions.</p>
	<p>Our competitors may include various incumbent database companies and other economic analysis web-platforms. However, we distinguish ourselves from the other players by providing data in a more accessible and easy to understand structure through the use of our charts and various other user-friendly features. Additionally, our motto is make IMA an effective portal for anybody to understand, learn and know about the Indian economy. Building a comprehensive dataset is the first step towards that goal followed by a concise and easy to understand analysis.</p>
	<p>India Macro Advisors (IMA) is a privately owned affiliate of the "Japan Macro Advisors" (JMA) group.</p>

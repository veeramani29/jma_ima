Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been increasing moderately', '<p>\r\n	International commodity prices have been more or less flat as a whole. Prices of crude oil&mdash;which had increased their levels slightly in view of geopolitical risks, mainly in response to the situation in the Middle East&mdash;have recently fallen back a bit mainly as a reflection of receding concern over the situation in the Middle East. Prices of nonferrous metals have generally been flat, after having bounced back slightly in August triggered by the upturn in some Chinese economic indicators. Prices of grains have been soft, mainly due to a bountiful harvest forecast.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The rate of change in import prices (on a yen basis) has been more or less flat since mid-year, after having risen consistently.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	{graph_narrow 145-13,145-3|152,144,143,133,130|2004-1,2013-11}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Domestic corporate goods prices (adjusted to exclude the effects of seasonal changes in electricity rates, same hereafter) are rising moderately relative to three months earlier against the backdrop of movements in international commodity prices and foreign exchange rates .

On a year-on-year basis, consumer prices&mdash;which had turned upward to positive 0.4 percent in June after having registered 0.0 percent in May&mdash;stood at positive 0.7 percent in September, after having risen at a somewhat accelerated pace in July and August with readings of positive 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, those on a basis that excludes food and energy&mdash;which had been narrowing their pace of decline moderately&mdash;improved in September by posting 0.0 percent (on par with the December 2008 level), after having stood at negative 0.1 percent in August. Regarded as a method for capturing trend changes, the year-on-year rate of change in the trimmed mean&mdash;which had ceased to improve since the middle of last year&mdash;has recently improved again; it has been accelerating at a very modest pace, after having turned marginally upward.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	{graph_narrow 133-2|152,144,143,133,130,135,145|2004-1,2013-11}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	{graph_narrow 133-6,133-10|152,144,143,133,130,135,145|2004-1,2013-11}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	{graph_narrow 135-0|144,143,133,130|2008-1,2013-10}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Looking at year-on-year movements in consumer prices in September, fees for public services reduced their pace of increase from the previous month, with the effects of price increases by electric power companies&mdash;which were introduced in the same month a year earlier&mdash;having waned. As for prices for goods, petroleum products, which comprise a large weight, reduced their rate of increase, since upward pressure in response to the previous year&#39;s movement had diminished. Nevertheless, prices of some categories, including durable goods, food products, other goods, and clothes appear to have either reduced their rate of decline or turned marginally upward, partly because cost increases have been passed on in the form of higher prices as a reflection of movements in foreign exchange rates under resilient private consumption. Meanwhile, prices of general services have not shown a discernable improvement as a whole, since prices of rent&mdash;which comprise a large weight&mdash;have continued to be somewhat sluggish. Prices of eating out, however, have increased marginally, and those of other services have been on a very modest but improving trend compared to a while ago, albeit with fluctuations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Domestic corporate goods prices are expected to rise at a reduced pace for the time being, reflecting movements in international commodity prices.

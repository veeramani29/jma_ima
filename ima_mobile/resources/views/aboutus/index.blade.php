			<p>The data on Indian economy is spread over many government websites in an unstructured format. Indian economy has always faced a problem of inadequacy of structured and "easy to use" accessible data. We feel that an economy should have an open data policy where the data should be public and easily available. We believe that the access to data should not just be available to corporates, researchers or policy makers, but for everyone. </p>
			<p>We (IMA) aim to provide well structured interactive online database portal for the Indian economy alongwith a concise and insightful analysis on the data. This would facilitate research across various sectors of the Indian economy. We hope such open and easy access to data would lead to a better understanding of the Indian economy among the general public, businesses, researchers and help them make better and informed decisions.</p>
			<p>Well structured macroeconomic data is a prerequisite for effective macroeconomic management, helping policy makers to map out better models for predicting the future scenarios and enable them to identify any adversities in the economy and take corrective measures for the same. We believe that public availability of reliable economic data reassures international investors by allowing them to effectively monitor the developments in an economy and manage their investment risks.</p>
